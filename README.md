## Problem Statement

Finance students struggle to find interactive practice platforms for technical concepts. Traditional textbooks lack immediate feedback, and existing quiz apps don't cover domain-specific topics like corporate governance, investment analysis, and ESG frameworks.

## Solution

An interactive practice platform that provides real-time feedback on finance fundamentals, built during the CISSA Catalyst Hackathon.

## Methodology

- **Content Structure** — Question banks organized by topic (Corporate Governance, Investment, ESG)
- **Adaptive Feedback** — Explanations for both correct and incorrect answers
- **Progress Tracking** — Session-based performance metrics
- **Modular Design** — Easy addition of new question categories

## Results

- 100+ curated finance questions across 5 categories
- Instant correctness feedback with detailed explanations
- Built and deployed in 24-hour hackathon timeframe

## Demo
